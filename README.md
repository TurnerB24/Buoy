# Buoy
SMS Message re-distribution tool for alerting many people by sending only one text.

## Usage
Simply create an instance with groups of SMS-capable numbers to alert, and start sending SMS messages to your Buoy! Buoy will then relay the message to any applicable recipients, as determined by your message grouping header (see more below). 

## Message Classes
Only want to send a message to certain parties? Organize them into groups! Let family know you're safe when travelling abroad, but tell your friends all about the club last night, all with little as one text!
